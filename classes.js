// # Class Exercises


// (1 - 8 are the same as on the previous lab, but creating classes using ES6 syntax instead of constructor functions)

// ## Question 1

// a. Write a class called `Person` that has 3 properties: a first name, a last name and a middle name. Create 2 instances of a `Person`. Print one of their first names.

class Person {
    constructor(first, last, middle) {
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last; 
        this.middle = middle;
    } 
    fullName() {
        return `${this.first} ${this.middle} ${this.last}`
    }
}
let bob = new Person ("bob", "robert", "bobby");
let sue = new Person ("sue", "soo", "su");
// console.log(sue.first)


// b. Write a method in `Person` called `fullName` that will return a formatted string of an instance's full name. Call this method on both the instances you created in part a.

// console.log(bob.fullName())
// console.log(sue.fullName())



// ## Question 2

// a. Create a class called `Book` that has properties `title`, `author` and `rating`. Create some instances of `Book`.

class Book {
    constructor(title, author, rating) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.rating = rating; 
    }
    isGood() {
        if(this.rating >= 7) {
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
}

let books = new Book("Half of a Yellow Sun", "Chimamanda Adichie", 9) 
let bs = new Book("Trump: The Art of the Deal", "Donald Trump", 1.9)

// console.log(books)

// b. Add a method to `Book` called `isGood` that returns `true` if its rating is greater than or equal to 7

// console.log(bs.isGood())

// ## Question 3

// a. Create a `Dog` class with four properties: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.

class Dog {
    constructor(name, breed, mood, hungry) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed; 
        this.mood = mood;
        this.hungry = hungry
    }
    playFetch() {
        // console.log("Roof!")
        return this.hungry = true, this.mood = "playful"
    }
    feed() {
        if(this.hungry = false) {
            return "Woof!"
        } else {
            return "This dog is not hungry!"
        }

    }
    toString() {
        return("This is " + this.name + ", the " + this.breed + " and " + this.name + " is " + this.mood + ". Hungry? " + this.hungry)
    }
}




let zola = new Dog("Zozo", "Pitbull", "Meloncholy", false)
// console.log(zola)

// b. Add a method called `playFetch`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and log "Ruff!"

zola.playFetch()
// console.log(zola)

// c. Add a method called `feed`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should log "The dog doesn't look hungry"

// console.log(zola.feed())

// d. Add a method called `toString` that returns a description of the dog:

// console.log(zola.toString())

// ## Question 4

// There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

// C = (F - 32) / 1.8
// F = 1.8 * C + 32
// K = C + 273

// a. Make an object called `freezingPoint` that has three properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.
let freezingPoint = {
    "celsuis": 0,
    "fahrenheit": 32,
    "kelvin": 273
}

// b. Make a class called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`.

// ```js
// let outsideTempt = new Celsius(10.0)
// outsideTempt.celsius //returns 10.0
// outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
// outsideTempt.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0
// ```
class Celsius {
    constructor(celsius){
        this.celsius = celsius;
    }
    getFahrenheit(){
        return 1.8 * this.celsius + 32
    }
    getKelvinTemp(){
        return this.celsius + 273
    }
    isBelowFreezing(){
        if(this.celsius < 0){
            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
}
let outsideTempt = new Celsius(10.0)
console.log(outsideTempt.celsius)
console.log(outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp())
console.log(outsideTempt.getFahrenheit())
// c. Give `Celsius` a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).
console.log(outsideTempt.isBelowFreezing())
// ## Question 5

// a. Create a class called `Movie` that has properties for `name`, `year`, `genre`, `cast`, and `description`. Create an instance of your `Movie`
class Movie {
    constructor(name, year, genre, cast, description){
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
        this.genre = genre;
        this.cast = cast;
        this.description = description;
    }
    blurb() {
        return `${this.name} came out in ${this.year}. It was a ${this.description} ${this.genre} movie.`
    }
}

let moxie = new Movie("Despicable Me", 2009,"amimation","steve carell","funny")
// b. Create an method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

// Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."
console.log(moxie.blurb())

// ## Question 6

// Write a class Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
// It takes two number arguments: `x` and `y` parameters, which it should be saved to properties of the same name.

class Vector {
    constructor(x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    plus(vector) {
        return this.x + num
    }
    minus(vector) {
        return this.y - num 
    }
    getLength(num){
        // return this.x^2 + this.y^2 = num^2
    }
}

var v1 = new Vector(1, 2)
var v2 = new Vector(2, 3)
console.log(v1.plus(v2))
// Give the Vector prototype two methods, `plus` and `minus`, that take another vector as an argument and
// returns a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectorsâ€™ (the one in `this` and the parameter) x and y values.

console.log(vec1.minus(4))

// Add a method `getLength` to the prototype that computes the length of the vector ;
// that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

// [Vectors at mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html)

// ```js
// var v1 = new Vector(1, 2)
// var v2 = new Vector(2, 3)
// console.log(v1.plus(v2));
// // => Vector {x: 3, y: 5}
// console.log(v1.minus(v2));
// // => Vector {x: -1, y: -1}

// var v3 = new Vector(3, 4)
// console.log(v3.getLength());
// // => 5
// ```
// ## Question 7

// a. Write a class called `Cylinder` that has properties `radius` and `height`.  Create an instance of a Cylinder.

// b. Add an instance method `getVolume` that returns the [volume](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylindervolume.html)

// c. Add an instance method `getSurfaceArea` that returns the [surface area](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylinderareamain.html)

// ## Question 8

// [Dates in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-date-and-time-in-javascript#targetText=The%20Date%20object%20is%20a,the%20current%20date%20and%20time.)

// a. Write a class called `Post` that has properties `datePosted`, `user`, and `text`.  Create an array of `Post` objects.

// b. Create an instance method that returns whether or not the post was made today.

// c. Filter your array of `Post` objects to only include posts made today.

// ## Question 9

// a. Make a class called `Car` with properties `make` and `model`.  Create an instance of a `Car`

// b. Make a class called `Bike` with properties `gears` and `hasBell`.  Create an instance of `Bike`

// c. Give each class a static method called `numberOfWheels` that returns the number of wheels (2 for bikes, 4 for cars).  Why does it make sense for this to be a static method instead of an instance method?

// ## Question 10

// a. Make a class called `Vehicle` with properties `color` and `name`.  Give it a method called `makeSound` which logs "WHHOOSSSH" to the console

// b. Modify your `Car` and `Bike` classes from Question 7 to extend the `Vehicle` class.

// c. Create a new `Bike` instance that has a `color` of "green" and `name` "Bikey McBikeface"

// d. Create a new `Car` instance that has a `color` of "red" and `name` "Carry McCarface"
